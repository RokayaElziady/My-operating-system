# My-operating-system

The Operating System keeps multiple jobs in the main memory, these are
the jobs waiting to be executed. The Operating System will choose one of these
jobs and begins execution. Once this job needs an I/O operation, the Operating
System switches to another job. If several jobs are ready to run at the same time,
then the Operating System chooses which one to run through the process of CPU
Scheduling.
